# Instructions
Modify your button GUI program so that the buttons change color, automatically, about every second unless they've been pressed. Pressing the button should disable only the pressed button, the others should still change colors. Pressing the same button a second time should re-activate it's changing (like an on/off toggle). Multiple buttons can be stopped on a color at any given point.
