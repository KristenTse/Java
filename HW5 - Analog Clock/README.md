# Instructions
Using the Graphics class, we would like to design a program to draw an analog clock. The Clock should have three "hands" one for the hours, minutes and seconds. In an analog clock, the hour hand is small in length but larger in width, the minute hand is smaller in width and longer and the seconds hand is the smallest in width and usually the same length as the minute hand. We would like our clock to "tic" once for each second and display the correct time (Use Calendar class), but does not have to be accurate down to the millisecond, close is good enough here.

If you're having trouble with the widths of the hands, just change their color and make them all the same width. The Hour hand should be red, the minute hand blue and the second hand purple.

On a good analog clock, at 6:30 PM, the hour and minute hand would NOT line up because the hour hand would be advanced half way towards the 7th hour. 

You can make your program default to a 400 by 400 size screen, but, ultimately, the user can change the size of the screen by resizing (dragging) it.
